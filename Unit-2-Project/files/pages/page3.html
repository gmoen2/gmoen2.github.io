<h1>In My Opinion, The winner of The Battle Between The Engines is: Unity!</h1>

I believe Unreal is the better choice as an engine. While the license agreemnet is a little more obscure, the more simplistic interface and organization of Unity over Unreal is a big game changer. There are also a ton of great indie games made from Unity compared to Unreal.
