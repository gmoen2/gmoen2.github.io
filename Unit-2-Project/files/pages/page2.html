                <p>Unreals big pro are it's great graphics. With Unreal Engine 5 out, people can make some really beautiful games. It's also free! Not only that their license aggreement is very straight forward. On Unreals free download page they say they don't take any royalties until your game reaches over 1 million USD, where they then charge a 5% royalty. Which if you think about it is pretty low as Steam charges 30% per sale of the game sold.</p>

                <p>Unreal having such superior graphics also requires much more work to learn how to use it. The interface is much more complicated than other game engines. Unreal if for very large projects where it may not be very suitable/optimized for indie developers.</p>
