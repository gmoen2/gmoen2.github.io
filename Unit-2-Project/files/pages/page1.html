                <p>Unity great cons are some of license aggreements, they arn't very direct and you should read the fine print before signing your life away. They may not give you as much freedom when it comes to selling your game as other game engines. As well as that, their graphics are still a little behind other, although it doesn't take great graphics to make a great game.</p>
